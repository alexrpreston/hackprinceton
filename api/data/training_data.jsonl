{"completion":"Somewhat Biased","prompt":"The appeals court panel that rejected Trump\u2019s request to keep the documents secret in\u00a0Trump v.

Although the\u00a0Thompson\u00a0opinion accurately describes the current state of federal law governing congressional investigations, the Supreme Court may very well change that law to accommodate Trump \u2014 after all, it\u00a0already did so once\u00a0when Trump was president."}

{"completion":"Not biased","prompt":"80% of the 150,000 Russian troops stationed at Ukraine\u2019s borders have invaded the country, a Pentagon official told the New York Times. But fuel and food shortages among the Russian forces have led to poor morale, and fierce Ukrainian opposition has caused some entire Russian units to surrender without a fight or deliberately sabotage their own vehicles, the official said. These issues may be why the 40-mile-long convoy of Russian tanks and armored vehicles en route to Kyiv has significantly slowed over the past two days."}

{"completion":"Not biased","prompt":"Labor unions in the United States are organizations that represent workers in many industries recognized under US labor law. Their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA) codified the federal government's guarantees of workers' right to organize into unions and to engage in collective bargaining. The NLRA is enforced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which conducts elections to determine whether workers want to be represented by a union, and investigates and remedies unfair labor practices committed by either unions or employers. The largest federation of unions in the United States is the AFL-CIO, which comprises 53 national and international unions representing 12 million members. The AFL-CIO engages in substantial political activity on behalf of its member unions, including spending $157 million on lobbying and $28 million on campaign contributions during the 2012 election cycle. In recent years, labor unions have seen a decline in membership. In 2013, 11.3% of American workers were members of a union, down from 20.1% in 1983. The decrease in union membership is largely due to the decline in private-sector union membership, as public-sector union membership has remained relatively stable."}
{"completion":"Not biased","prompt":"Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods and\/or services between two or more parties. Trade is often seen as a win-win situation, as each party involved typically benefits from the exchange. There are a number of benefits that can be derived from trade. For instance, trade can lead to increased efficiency as parties are able to specialize in the production of particular goods or services. This specialization can lead to increased productivity, which can in turn lead to higher incomes and improved living standards. In addition, trade can also lead to increased competition, which can help to keep prices down and improve the quality of goods and services on offer. Trade can also provide opportunities for businesses to access new markets and to expand their operations. Finally, trade can also help to promote peace and understanding between different cultures and societies. By encouraging people from different backgrounds to interact with one another, trade can help to break down barriers and promote greater understanding and cooperation. Overall, trade is a process that can bring a number of benefits to those involved. In a world that is increasingly interconnected, trade is likely to become even more important in the years ahead."}
